# Bike Sales Data Analysis  

This repository contains files from my **Bike Sales Data Analysis** project, which I completed following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdGJWloo-OU&t=18s). This was my first experience using **SQL** and **Power BI**, and it provided a great introduction to data analysis and visualization.  

## 📂 Contents  

- **`bike.sql`**: SQL queries for analyzing bike sales data, written using **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.  
- **`BI_dashboard.JPG`**: A snapshot of the Power BI dashboard created to visualize key insights from the dataset.  

## 📊 Analysis Overview  

This project explores a dataset of bike sales and includes insights such as:  
- **Hourly Sales Across a Week**: Understanding peak sales times.  
- **Sum of Revenue and Profit**: Overall financial performance metrics.  
- **Rider Demographics**: Identifying customer trends.  
- **Revenue by Season**: Seasonal sales patterns.  
- **Number of Riders**: Tracking customer volume.  
- **Profit Margin**: Evaluating profitability.  

## 🎯 Purpose  

The purpose of this project is twofold:  
1. To showcase my journey of learning **SQL** and **Power BI**.  
2. To provide a resource for beginners interested in database analysis and visualization techniques.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  

- **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**  
- **Power BI**  

## 💡 How to Use  

- Review the `bike.sql` file for SQL queries used in this analysis.  
- Check out `BI_dashboard.JPG` to see how the insights are presented visually.  

Feel free to fork this repository, explore the files, or use this project as inspiration for your own SQL and Power BI learning journey!
